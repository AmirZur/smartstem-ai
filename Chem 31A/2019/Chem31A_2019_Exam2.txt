4) [25 points] A mixture of two gases, ethane (C2H6) and butane (C4H10) having a combined partial
pressure of 0.75 atm are combined in a rigid vessel of fixed volume with excess pure oxygen at an initial
partial pressure of 2.81 atm at 298 K. After the combustion reaction, the vessel is cooled to 298 K and
analysis reveals all the ethane and butane are consumed but the partial pressure of the remaining O2 is
0.295 atm at 298 K.
2 C2H6 (g) + 5 O2 (g) à 4 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (g)

6) [25 points] Jessica is investigating a new alternative method of getting energy from visible light
emitted by the sun through the photoelectric effect. She is testing different metals with different light to
see if she can get a viable current flowing. One alloy tested has an especially low photoelectric binding
energy of Φ = 1.69 eV (1 eV = 1.602 × 10-./ J). Jessica is currently shining a green laser (wavelength
� = 514 nm) on the metal, but it is producing electrons that are too slow! Let vgreen be the velocity of
electrons produced by the green light.
