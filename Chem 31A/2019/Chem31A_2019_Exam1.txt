2) Short Answer [40 points]

a. When two electrodes from the battery were placed in a solution of ZnI2(aq):
i.) What did you observe at each electrode (call them electrode A and Electrode B)
Electrode A:
Electrode B:
ii) What color was the solution prior to introducing the electrodes?

iii.) What color appeared in the solution after the electrodes were introduced?

iv.) Can you identify what was responsible for the color that appeared in the solution?

b. Consider the compounds, P2O5 and P4O10. Could the Law of Multiple Proportions be
used to distinguish between the two molecules? Briefly explain your reasoning.

c. The nucleus of a silicon-30 atom has a radius of approximately 1.0 fm whereas the
atomic radius of silicon-30 atom is 0.200 nm. Assuming that we can treat the atom and
nucleus as a sphere, the nucleus makes up what percentage by volume of the entire atom?
Volume of Sphere = (4/3)pr

3). Combustion analysis of a hydrocarbon produces 33.01 g CO2 and 10.14 g H2O. [30 points]

a) Calculate the empirical formula of this hydrocarbon. The hydrocarbon consists of only carbon
and hydrogen.

b) If a gaseous sample of this hydrocarbon in a 1.00 L container has a mass of 2.20 g at 1.00 atm
and 26.9°C, calculate the molecular formula of this hydrocarbon.

4) Carbon capture technology is being explored as an approach to remove carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere. Several reactions of carbon dioxide are being explored using this technology with
one being the conversion of carbon dioxide into methanol (CH3OH, density = 0.79 g/mL), which
is widely used in organic research laboratories as a solvent or building block for larger
molecules. Approximately 0.55 lbs of carbon dioxide are generated per mile driven in a car. If
someone drives 30 miles per day for 300 days, how many liters of methanol could be generated
if the reaction of CO2 with H2 proceeds in 92% yield?
Assume hydrogen gas is in excess. [25 points]
1 lb = 0.454 kg
Carbon Capture Reaction: CO2 (g) + H2 (g) à CH3OH (l) + H2O (l) (unbalanced)

5) Solutions of 0.10 M BaCl2 and of 0.30 M NaF were mixed to give a precipitate of BaF2.
[30 points]
(a.) Write a balanced net ionic equation for the formation of BaF2. Include phases: (s), (l), (g),
and (aq).

(b.) If you have 10.0 mL of the 0.10 M BaCl2, what volume (in mL) of 0.30 M NaF is needed
to react completely?

6) In 1669, phosphorus was discovered from putrefied urine. While effective, this is not the most
pleasant way to make phosphorus. Today, we can use phosphate-containing rocks and other
materials to isolate pure phosphorus, which has the form P4 in nature.
Consider the reaction of 0.100 grams of Ca3(PO4)2 (s) with 0.250 grams of carbon, C, and 0.443
grams of SiO2. If the percent yield is 80%, what mass of P4 is produced? [30 points]
2 Ca3(PO4)2 (s) + 10 C (s) + 6 SiO2 (s) à 6 CaSiO3 (l) + 10 CO (g) + P4 (g)
