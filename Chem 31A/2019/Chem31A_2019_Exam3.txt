The solubility of one molecule in another is governed by the general rule "like dissolves like".

That is, polar molecules tend to be soluble in liquids that are made up of polar molecules; non-
polar molecules are soluble in liquids made up of non-polar molecules.

	SCl2 SF6

Estimate the Zeff for the ionized electron in sulfur.

7) [30 points] Lieke first reported the synthesis of isocyanides in 1859. Many scientists initially
avoided using the compounds for synthetic purposes because of their awful smells – worse than a
skunk by Dr. Cox’s opinion. Despite the horrible smell, these structures have been widely used
in the synthesis of antibiotics. One synthesis is shown below.

(a.) Draw a Lewis Structure of POCl3 (in which all formal charges are zero) and identify the
molecular geometry based upon the structure.

the molecule has a net dipole moment.

(c.) Identify the hybridization at the indicated atoms in methyl isocyanide.

(d.) Acetonitrile is an "isomer" (same # of atoms, with different arrangement). Use bond enthalpies
for the isomerization (rearrangement reaction) of methyl isocyanide to acetonitrile (shown below) to
estimate the DH°rxn.

exothermic endothermic
