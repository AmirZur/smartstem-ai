(a.) Use molecular orbital theory to estimate the bond order of HeH+

In interstellar space, HeH+ captures an electron to generate a short-lived species HeH, which within 10 seconds at a temperature of 6 K dissociates to He in its lowest energy (ground state) and H in a high energy (excited) n = 2 state.
(b.) Use a molecular orbital diagram to explain why HeH is not stable and dissociates to He and
H even at 6 K.

(c.) Identify the molecular orbital (circle one letter) that represents the highest energy electron in the uncharged HeH.

(d.) Upon dissociation of HeH, the H atom is generated in a high energy n = 2 state. Identify the
atomic orbital (circle one letter) that corresponds to the electron in the n=2 state of the excited H atom.

4) [46 points] Sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4) solution is often used as a standard for measuring the
concentration of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution. In the presence of acid (H+), two
solutions react as the following net ionic equation:
5 C2O42- (aq) + 2 MnO4- (aq) + 16 H+ (aq) → 2 Mn2+ (aq) + 10CO2 (g) + 8H2O (l)

After mixing 10 mL 0.05 M Na2C2O4 solution and 10 mL 0.03 M KMnO4 solution in an open beaker
(constant external pressure), the temperature has risen by 1.56 °C. Assume that Na2C2O4 and KMnO4
solutions both have density of 1 g/cm3, and heat capacities similar to that of water. (4.18 J/g o
C)
(a.) Calculate the ΔHrxn of the reaction between oxalate ions and permanganate ions
(HOW COME DELTA H RENDERS HERE BUT ELSEWHERE IT BECOMES DHrxn)

(b.) A 1.00 gram mixture of CaCl2 and MgCl2 is added to a 1.40 L solution containing excess
K2C2O4 to form a precipitate with a mass of 1.17 g. Calculate the mass of CaCl2 in the 1.00 gram
mixture.

5) [40 points] The Breaking Bad Problem! Yes, it is one of Dr. Cox’s favorite shows. In the episode of Breaking Bad titled "Crazy Handful of Nothin'", Walter White used mercury (II) fulminate to
blow up Tuco Salamanca's headquarters. Walter White knew his chemistry on the show. This
problem will walk you through a series of analyses to have you deduce whether the chemistry of
mercury fulminate was depicted correctly or whether Hollywood actually got it wrong!
(a.) Fulminate, ONC-, is a very unstable compound. Draw the resonance structures that satisfy the
octet for fulminate. Circle the major resonance contributor.

(b.) The following illustrates the explosive decomposition of mercury fulminate.
2 Hg(CNO)2 →2 CO2 (g) + N2 (g) + Hg (l) + Hg(CN)2 (s)

Calculate the heat absorbed or released for the decomposition of 40.0 cm3 of mercury fulminate
using the information below. The density of mercury fulminate is 4.43 g/cm3.

Hg (l) + 2 C (s,graphite) + N2 (g) + O2(g) à Hg(CNO)2 (s) DHfo = +270 kJ/mol

Hg (l) + 2C (s,graphite) + N2 (g) à Hg(CN)2 (s) DHfo = +264 kJ/mol

C (s, graphite) + O2 (g) à CO2(g) DHfo = -393.5 kJ/mol

5) (Breaking Bad continued)
The "Mythbusters" team decided to compare the magnitude of the explosion using mercury fulminate
with that of TNT (C7H5N3O6 (s)). The balanced equation for the explosive decomposition of
TNT is given below:
C7H5N3O6 (s) à 7 CO (g) + 7 C (s,graphite) + 5 H2O (g) + 3 N2 (g)

(c.) Based on your knowledge gained from Chem 31A, predict which explosive would generate a more
powerful explosion (circle one), assuming one mole of each explosive were detonated.

Mercury Fulminate TNT

(d.) Explain why the same number of moles of your choice in part (c.) would have generated a more
powerful explosion. (Assume the DHrxn are the same for the two explosions)

6) [26 points] Before majoring in chemistry, Dr. Cox provided his lack of acting talent to help his sister produce a low budget horror film. Dr. Cox was the first victim and his acting career consisted of no more than 5 minutes. During this time, Dr. Cox learned that iron thiocyanate [Fe(SCN)]2+ is used to depict fake blood in movies.

To perceive the formation of blood, iron (III) chloride is added to skin and potassium thiocyanate
is coated on a weapon of choice. When the two compounds mix, the actors runs around and
screams as the reddish iron thiocyanate is produced – mimicking real blood.
The chemical reaction is:
KSCN (aq) + FeCl3 (aq) à [Fe(SCN)]2+ (aq) + KCl (aq) + 2 Cl- (aq)

(a.)What is the electron configuration of iron in FeCl3?

(b.)The UV/Vis spectrum below was acquired using a .15× 10-4 M concentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+
in a 1.00 cm cuvette. If excess potassium thiocyanate is contained in a 1.2 L solution, how
many grams of FeCl3 should be added to the 1.2 L solution to give an absorbance of 0.80.

7) [36 points] Consider the two chamber system below. Bulb A (1 L) contains a 1:1 ratio (by moles) of
O2 and an unknown gas and an initial pressure of 1.0 atm. Bulb B (3L) contains 0.1 atm of N2.

(a.)In the apparatus shown, the valve between Bulb A and Bulb B is opened for a short period of time
to allow some of the gases from Bulb A to escape to Bulb B and then closed. A detector in Bulb
B finds that the mole ratio of the resulting gas mixture is 1.2 O2 : 4.8 unknown : 94 N2. Assuming
all gases behave ideally, and the temperature is equal in both bulbs, what is the identity of the
unknown gas?

(b.)The valve is opened again, and the gases distribute equally between the two bulbs. What is the
final partial pressure of O2 in the two bulbs, assuming temperature is constant and the same in both
bulbs?

8) [62 points] Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is a colorless gas and the principal industrial source of fluorine, often as an aqueous solution called hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid is an extremely corrosive liquid, reacting with metals, metal oxides and even glass, and therefore can be stored only in plastic containers.

(a.)In one sentence, provide an explanation for the observation that HF has a significantly higher
boiling point (19.5°C) than HCl (-85°C).

(b.)In one sentence, provide an explanation for the observation that HBr has a higher boiling point
(-66°C) than HCl (-85°C).

(c.)Consider the following unbalanced reaction. If 30 mL of 10.9 M hydrofluoric acid is placed
in a 50 mL SiO2 glass beaker with a mass of 27.82 g, how many grams of SiO2 will be unreacted
in the end?
HF + SiO2 à SiF4 + H2O

HF is important in the preparation of many important compounds including Teflon, a long polymer
molecule containing C-F bonds (CF3-(CF2CF2)n-CF3). Teflon is inert partly because of the strength of
carbon–fluorine bonds. The synthesis of tetrafluoroethylene, the precursor of Teflon, includes the
following steps:

CHCl3 + 2 HF → CHClF2 + 2 HCl DHorxn = -42 kJ/mol

2 CHClF2 → C2F4 + 2 HCl

Given the enthalpy for the first reaction is -42 kJ/mol,
and the bond energies of C-Cl, H-Cl and H-F bonds are
