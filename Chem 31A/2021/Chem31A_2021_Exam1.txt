2) Short Answer [40 points]
a) Suppose Elon Musk drives from Los Angeles to San Francisco
(382 miles) in a 2021 Tesla Model 3, which has standard-range
battery with a rating of 24.0 kWh/100 miles. If he charges his car
on the California grid, where 48.35% of electricity is generated
from natural gas, 0.170% from coal, 0.0200% from oil, and the
rest from renewable energy (assume no CO2 is emitted from
renewable energy), how many kilograms of CO2 were emitted to
generate the electricity required for his trip? (See Table below)

b) We saw in lab that the reaction of acetic acid with sodium
bicarbonate produces water, carbon dioxide, and sodium acetate
(see balanced equation below). You add 95 mL of a 0.933 molar
(M) aqueous solution of acetic acid (molar mass: 60.05 g/mol)
containing red cabbage pH indicator to an open beaker and
record the total mass as 275 g. You then add 5.0 g of sodium
bicarbonate (molar mass: 84.0 g/mol) to the jar, stir, and wait for
the reaction to finish. After the reaction is complete, you weigh the jar again. Assume the mass of pH indicator is negligible (it doesn’t contribute anything to the overall mass).

i.) What color is the liquid in the beaker after the reaction is complete? Justify your answer with a
calculation.

ii.) When you weigh the jar after the reaction, do you expect the mass to be about equal to 280g, less than 280g or more than 280g? Briefly explain your answer.

c) Aqueous lead nitrate reacts with potassium iodide to form solid lead iodide as a precipitate. The
balanced molecular equation is shown below. If 1.54 g of potassium iodide reacts completely with
excess lead nitrate in an aqueous solution to form 1.46 g of lead iodide precipitate, what is the percent
yield of the reaction?
Molar Mass (Pb(NO3)2): 331.2 g/mol; (KI): 166.0 g/mol; (PbI2): 461.0 g/mol; (KNO3): 101.1 g/mol

Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2KI (aq) à PbI2 (s) + 2KNO3 (aq)

3) [35 points] You obtain a small sample of an unknown compound extracted from the bark of a South
American tree. The indigenous people used powders of this bark to treat shivering. To identify this
compound, the following experiments were carried out.
Exp. #1: 25.10 mg of a sample of the pure compound was combusted to yield 18.58 mg carbon
Exp. #2: 25.10 mg of a sample of the pure compound was analyzed to yield 2.167 mg nitrogen
Exp. #3: 25.10 mg of a sample of the pure compound was combusted to yield 1.872 mg
hydrogen
Exp. #4: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (we’ll learn this technique later) indicated the pure
compound contained only the following elements: C, H, N, O.
Exp. #5: A low resolution mass spectrum of the pure compound yield an ion corresponding to
the mass 324 amu.

4) [35 points]. 95.3 g of FeS2 and 54.0 L of O2 are sealed in a sealed 54.0 L container at 398 K and 1.20atm. These two react to generate Fe2O3 and sulfur dioxide. The molar mass of FeS2 is 119.99 g/mol
and that of Fe2O3(s) is 159.687 g/mol.
4 FeS2(s) + 11 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s) + 8 SO2(g)
a) How many grams of Fe2O3(s) would be generated?

b) What would be the final pressure in the sealed 54.0L container if, at the end of the reaction, the
container was held at 25°C?

5) [35 points]. Hydrogen Fluoride is a highly toxic molecule used in many industrial chemical
processes. It can also be dissolved in water to form hydrofluoric acid. Exposure to hydrogen fluoride
or hydrofluoric acid can not only cause tissue damage but can also cause systemic problems since
fluoride precipitates calcium out of solution, and a significant decrease in the concentration of
calcium ions in the blood can cause cardiac arrest and death.
a) Write the chemical formulas for hydrogen fluoride and calcium fluoride

b) Write the balanced net ionic equation for the precipitation of calcium fluoride from fluoride
and calcium ions in your blood (an aqueous solution) - Don’t forget to indicate states of matter!

c) A common treatment for skin exposure to hydrofluoric acid is to apply a gel containing
calcium gluconate to the site of exposure as soon as possible. Calcium gluconate is a calcium
salt that is soluble in water, where it dissolves into calcium and gluconate ions. In one or two
sentences, describe how calcium gluconate likely works to treat hydrofluoric acid exposure.
The molecular formula of calcium gluconate is Ca(C6H11O7)2.

d) Calcium gluconate gel is usually provided at a concentration of 2.5% calcium gluconate by
mass. If you spill 5.00 mL of a 28.9 mM aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride on your arm,
what is the minimum mass of calcium gluconate gel you should apply to your arm to
precipitate all the fluoride? The molar mass of calcium gluconate is 430.37 g/mol.
