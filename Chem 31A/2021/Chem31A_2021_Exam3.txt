draw 3-dimensional representations.

all found in the human bloodstream and are responsible for regulating blood pH.
a) Three resonance structures for each molecule are shown below. Circle the resonance structure
(or structures) that contributes the most to the actual structure of each molecule. If you feel
that more than one structure equally contributes the most to the actual structure of a molecule,
circle each of them.

i) [CO3]2—
ii) [HCO3] —
iii) H2CO3

b) Which of the three molecules should have 3 C-O bonds of equal length? Circle all that apply. If
none, circle “none”

[CO3]2— [HCO3]—  H2CO3  None

c) Using your answers to part (a), explain your choice(s) for part (b) in a few sentences.

4) [22 POINTS]. Ozone (O3) in the stratosphere absorbs high energy photons resulting in bond
cleavage. Recombination of the oxygen atom with dioxygen regenerates an ozone molecule
completing the chemical cycle.
O3(g) + hn ---> O(g) + O2(g)
O(g) + O2(g) -----> O3(g) + heat

a) The minimum energy photon (E=hn), to dissociate (i.e. break) a bond in ozone has a wavelength
of 360 nm. Calculate the average bond energy (in kJ/mole) of an ozone oxygen-oxygen
bond.

b) Draw the best possible Lewis dot structure(s) of ozone, including any equally contributing
resonance structures, if appropriate. Clearly indicate your final answer(s). You do not need to
draw 3-dimensional representation(s).

c) Does the bond energy you calculated in part (a) agree with your Lewis dot structure(s) in part (b)
and the average bond energies given below? Explain why or why not.
Average bond energies: O=O, 495 kJ/mole; O-O, 146 kJ/mole

5) [18 points]. Silicon is a key element in all semiconductor devices.
Consider the successive ionization energies of Silicon: IE1, IE2, IE3... IE7.., where

IE1: Si -> Si+ + 1 e- IE5: Si4+ -> Si5+ + 1 e-
IE2: Si+ -> Si2+ + 1 e- IE6: Si5+ -> Si6+ + 1 e-
IE3: Si2+-> Si3+ + 1 e- IE7: Si6+ -> Si7+ + 1 e-
IE4: Si3+-> Si4+ + 1 e-
a) Which of the successive ionization energies shown above will exhibit the largest change in the
magnitude of the ionization energy relative to the previous ionization energy?

b) Explain why the ionization energy you chose exhibits such a large increase in magnitude
compared the previous ionization energy.

Silane (SiH4) is a pyrophoric gas (it spontaneously catches fire in air) that can be used to make
ultra-pure silicon dioxide SiO2.
c) Draw a 3-dimensional representation of SiH4. What is the molecular geometry (i.e. the
molecular shape) of SiH4 and the hybridization of Si in SiH4? Clearly indicate your final
answer.

6) [30 points]. Infrared radiation released from Earth's surface can be absorbed by certain atmospheric
molecules to generate heat in the atmosphere. These molecules, called ‘greenhouse gases,’ include
carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). CO2 is released into the atmosphere through the
combustion of fossil fuels; the concentration of N2O is increasing due to agricultural and industrial
activities.

a) Draw all possible Lewis dot structure(s) of CO2 and N2O that contain full octets (include
resonance structures as necessary). Where appropriate, indicate which resonance structure is
likely to contribute the most to the overall structure. You do not need to draw a 3-dimensional
representation. Clearly indicate your final answer(s).
i) CO2
ii) N2O

b) Predict the molecular shapes of CO2 and N2O according to the VSEPR model.

c) A greenhouse gas is more potent if it has a permanent dipole moment. Which molecule would
you predict to be a more potent greenhouse gas? Explain your reasoning using your answers
to parts (a) and (b).
