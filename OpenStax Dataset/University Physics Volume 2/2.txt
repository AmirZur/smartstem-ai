30. In a common demonstration, a bottle is heated and stoppered with a hard-boiled egg that’s a little bigger than the bottle’s neck. When the bottle is cooled, the pressure difference between inside and outside forces the egg into the bottle.

51. There are two important isotopes of uranium, 235U and 238U; these isotopes are nearly identical chemically but have different atomic masses. Only 235U is very useful in nuclear reactors. Separating the isotopes is called uranium enrichment (and is often in the news as of this writing, because of concerns that some countries are enriching uranium with the goal of making nuclear weapons.) One of the techniques for enrichment, gas diffusion, is based on the different molecular speeds of uranium hexafluoride gas, UF6.

2.3 Heat Capacity and Equipartition of Energy
57. To give a helium atom nonzero angular momentum requires about 21.2 eV of energy (that is, 21.2 eV is the difference between the energies of the lowest-energy or ground state and the lowest-energy state with angular momentum). The electron-volt or eV is defined as 1.60×10−19J. Find the temperature T where this amount of energy equals kBT/2. Does this explain why we can ignore the rotational energy of helium for most purposes? (The results for other monatomic gases, and for diatomic gases rotating around the axis connecting the two atoms, have comparable orders of magnitude.)
58. (a) How much heat must be added to raise the temperature of 1.5 mol of air from 25.0°C to 33.0°C at constant volume? Assume air is completely diatomic. (b) Repeat the problem for the same number of moles of xenon, Xe.
59. A sealed, rigid container of 0.560 mol of an unknown ideal gas at a temperature of 30.0°C is cooled to −40.0°C. In the process, 980 J of heat are removed from the gas. Is the gas monatomic, diatomic, or polyatomic?
60. A sample of neon gas (Ne, molar mass M=20.2g/mol) at a temperature of 13.0°C is put into a steel container of mass 47.2 g that’s at a temperature of −40.0°C. The final temperature is−28.0°C. (No heat is exchanged with the surroundings, and you can neglect any change in the volume of the container.) What is the mass of the sample of neon?
61. A steel container of mass 135 g contains 24.0 g of ammonia, NH3, which has a molar mass of 17.0 g/mol. The container and gas are in equilibrium at 12.0°C. How much heat has to be removed to reach a temperature of −20.0°C ? Ignore the change in volume of the steel.
62. A sealed room has a volume of 24m3. It’s filled with air, which may be assumed to be diatomic, at a temperature of 24°C and a pressure of 9.83×104Pa. A 1.00-kg block of ice at its melting point is placed in the room. Assume the walls of the room transfer no heat. What is the equilibrium temperature?
63. Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, is sometimes given to hospital patients who have trouble breathing, because the low mass of helium makes it easier to breathe than air. Suppose helium at 25°C is mixed with oxygen at 35°C to make a mixture that is 70% helium by mole. What is the final temperature? Ignore any heat flow to or from the surroundings, and assume the final volume is the sum of the initial volumes.
64. Professional divers sometimes use heliox, consisting of 79% helium and 21% oxygen by mole. Suppose a perfectly rigid scuba tank with a volume of 11 L contains heliox at an absolute pressure of 2.1×107Pa at a temperature of 31°C. (a) How many moles of helium and how many moles of oxygen are in the tank? (b) The diver goes down to a point where the sea temperature is 27°C while using a negligible amount of the mixture. As the gas in the tank reaches this new temperature, how much heat is removed from it?
65. In car racing, one advantage of mixing liquid nitrous oxide (N2O) with air is that the boiling of the “nitrous” absorbs latent heat of vaporization and thus cools the air and ultimately the fuel-air mixture, allowing more fuel-air mixture to go into each cylinder. As a very rough look at this process, suppose 1.0 mol of nitrous oxide gas at its boiling point, −88°C, is mixed with 4.0 mol of air (assumed diatomic) at 30°C. What is the final temperature of the mixture? Use the measured heat capacity of N2O at 25°C, which is 30.4J/mol°C. (The primary advantage of nitrous oxide is that it consists of 1/3 oxygen, which is more than air contains, so it supplies more oxygen to burn the fuel. Another advantage is that its decomposition into nitrogen and oxygen releases energy in the cylinder.)

The horizontal scale is 0 to 1200 seconds per meter, with major grid lines every 0.0005 and with minor grid lines every 0.0001. The vertical scale is 0 to 0.0025 meters per second, with major grid lines every 200 and with minor grid lines every 20. The function peaks at v equal to about 350 with a value of f of about 0.00235.
