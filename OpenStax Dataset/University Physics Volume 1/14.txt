The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid, while the drag force is assumed to be given by Stokes Law, Fs=6πrηv. Show that the terminal speed is given by v=2R2g9η(ρs−ρ1), where R is the radius of the sphere, ρs is its density, and ρ1 is the density of the fluid, and η the coefficient of viscosity.
94. Using the equation of the previous problem, find the viscosity of motor oil in which a steel ball of radius 0.8 mm falls with a terminal speed of 4.32 cm/s. The densities of the ball and the oil are 7.86 and 0.88 g/mL, respectively.
95. A skydiver will reach a terminal velocity when the air drag equals his or her weight. For a skydiver with a large body, turbulence is a factor at high speeds.

Take the density of the oil to be 900kg/m3 and its viscosity to be 1.00(N/m2)⋅s (or 1.00Pa⋅s). Note that you must take into account the pressure due to the 50.0-m column of oil in the pipe.
