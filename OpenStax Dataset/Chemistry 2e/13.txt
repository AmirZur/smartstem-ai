The third structure shows a chain of atoms: “C H subscript 3, C H subscript 2, C H subscript 2, C H subscript 3,” a double-headed arrow, then a carbon atom single bonded to three C H subscript 3 groups as well as a hydrogen atom.

(b) Hydrogen is removed from the vessel until the partial pressure of nitrogen, at equilibrium, is 250 torr. Calculate the partial pressures of the other substances under the new conditions.

84. The equilibrium constant (Kc) for this reaction is 5.0 at a given temperature.

(a) On analysis, an equilibrium mixture of the substances present at the given temperature was found to contain 0.20 mol of CO, 0.30 mol of water vapor, and 0.90 mol of H2 in a liter. How many moles of CO2 were there in the equilibrium mixture?

(b) Maintaining the same temperature, additional H2 was added to the system, and some water vapor was removed by drying.
