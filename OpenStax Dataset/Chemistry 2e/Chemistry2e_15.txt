Solve the following problem:

MgF2(𝑠)⇌Mg2+(𝑎𝑞)+2F−(𝑎𝑞)

In a saturated solution of MgF2 at 18 °C, the concentration of Mg2+ is 1.21 × 10–3 M. The equilibrium is represented by the preceding equation.

(a) Write the expression for the solubility-product constant, Ksp, and calculate its value at 18 °C.

(b) Calculate the equilibrium concentration of Mg2+ in 1.000 L of saturated MgF2 solution at 18 °C to which 0.100 mol of solid KF has been added. The KF dissolves completely. Assume the volume change is negligible.

(c) Predict whether a precipitate of MgF2 will form when 100.0 mL of a 3.00 × 10–3-M solution of Mg(NO3)2 is mixed with 200.0 mL of a 2.00 × 10–3-M solution of NaF at 18 °C. Show the calculations to support your prediction.

(d) At 27 °C the concentration of Mg2+ in a saturated solution of MgF2 is 1.17 × 10–3 M. Is the dissolving of MgF2 in water an endothermic or an exothermic process? Give an explanation to support your conclusion.
