Initial concentrations and rates of reaction are given here.

Experiment	Initial Concentration [NO] (mol L−1)	Initial Concentration, [H2] (mol L−1 min−1)	Initial Rate of Formation of N2 (mol L−1 min−1)
1	0.0060	0.0010	1.8 × 10−4
2	0.0060	0.0020	3.6 × 10−4
3	0.0010	0.0060	0.30 × 10−4
4	0.0020	0.0060	1.2 × 10−4
Consider the following questions:

(a) Determine the order for each of the reactants, NO and H2, from the data given and show your reasoning.

(b) Write the overall rate law for the reaction.

(c) Calculate the value of the rate constant, k, for the reaction. Include units.

(d) For experiment 2, calculate the concentration of NO remaining when exactly one-half of the original amount of H2 had been consumed.

(e) The following sequence of elementary steps is a proposed mechanism for the reaction.

Step 1: NO+NO⇌N2O2

Step 2: N2O2+H2⇌H2O+N2O

Step 3: N2O+H2⇌N2+H2O

Based on the data presented, which of these is the rate determining step? Show that the mechanism is consistent with the observed rate law for the reaction and the overall stoichiometry of the reaction.

(b) Identify all intermediates.

(c) Write the rate law for each elementary reaction.

(d) Write the overall rate law expression.

12.7 Catalysis
76. Account for the increase in reaction rate brought about by a catalyst.
77. Compare the functions of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.
78. Consider this scenario and answer the following questions: Chlorine atoms resulting from decomposition of chlorofluoromethanes, such as CCl2F2, catalyze the decomposition of ozone in the atmosphere. One simplified mechanism for the decomposition is:
O3−→−−−sunlightO2+OO3+Cl⟶O2+ClOClO+O⟶Cl+O2
(a) Explain why chlorine atoms are catalysts in the gas-phase transformation:
2O3⟶3O2

(b) Nitric oxide is also involved in the decomposition of ozone by the mechanism:
O3−→−−−sunlightO2+OO3+NO⟶NO2+O2NO2+O⟶NO+O2

Is NO a catalyst for the decomposition? Explain your answer.

79. For each of the following pairs of reaction diagrams, identify which of the pair is catalyzed:
(a)

In this figure, two graphs are shown. The x-axes are labeled, “Extent of reaction,” and the y-axes are labeled, “Energy (k J).” The y-axis of the first graph is marked off from 0 to 30 in intervals of 5. The y-axis of the second graph is marked off from 0 to 25 by intervals of 5. In a, a blue curve is shown. It begins with a horizontal region at about 12. The curve then rises sharply near the middle to reach a maximum of about 24 and similarly falls to another horizontal segment at 5. In b, the curve begins and ends similarly, but the maximum reached near the center of the graph is only 20.
(b)

In this figure, two graphs are shown. The x-axes are labeled, “Extent of reaction,” and the y-axes are labeled, “Energy.” The y-axes are marked off from 0 to 50 in intervals of 5.

The curve then rises sharply near the middle to reach a maximum of about 43 and similarly falls to another horizontal segment at 15.
