This green line is labeled, “H e.” An orange curve dips below the horizontal ideal gas line initially, then increases to cross the line just past 1 a t m. This curve reaches a value of about 22.52 a t m L at 2 a t m. This curve is labeled, “C H subscript 4.” A purple curve dips below the horizontal ideal gas line initially, then increases to cross the line at about 0.8 a t m. This curve reaches a value of nearly 22.62 a t m L at nearly 1.2 a t m. This curve is labeled, “C O subscript 2.”
101. Under which of the following sets of conditions does a real gas behave most like an ideal gas, and for which conditions is a real gas expected to deviate from ideal behavior? Explain.
(a) high pressure, small volume

(b) high temperature, low pressure

(c) low temperature, high pressure

102. Describe the factors responsible for the deviation of the behavior of real gases from that of an
ideal gas.

103. For which of the following gases should the correction for the molecular volume be largest:
CO, CO2, H2, He, NH3, SF6?

104. A 0.245-L flask contains 0.467 mol CO2 at 159 °C. Calculate the pressure:
(a) using the ideal gas law

(b) using the van der Waals equation

(c) Explain the reason for the difference.

(d) Identify which correction (that for P or V) is dominant and why.

105. Answer the following questions:
(a) If XX behaved as an ideal gas, what would its graph of Z vs. P look like?

(b) For most of this chapter, we performed calculations treating gases as ideal. Was this justified?

(c) What is the effect of the volume of gas molecules on Z? Under what conditions is this effect small? When is it large? Explain using an appropriate diagram.

(d) What is the effect of intermolecular attractions on the value of Z? Under what conditions is this effect small? When is it large? Explain using an appropriate diagram.

(e) In general, under what temperature conditions would you expect Z to have the largest deviations from the Z for an ideal gas?
